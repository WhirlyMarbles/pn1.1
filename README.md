# Picklnicker 1.1
---
This is the 1.1 update for Picklnicker. If someone can help me with the atrocious "PermissionError", PLEASE DO.
---

This update implenets class usage, along with pumping up the readability of the code. It also adds the "launch UI" to the base code (instead of a different,
extremely hard-coded module named "pnlauncher" which actually import the game code. It also adds the difficulty settings, PICKLNICKER json file, and
some easter eggs ;).
