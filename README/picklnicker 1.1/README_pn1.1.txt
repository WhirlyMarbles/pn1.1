Hello!

This is the go-to README file for PN1.1. This includes all the basics, including:
- Instructions
- Requirements
- Credits

Instructions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Launcher:
        Pretty intuitive. I'm not gonna add anything here.
    
    Game:
        Use A/D to move. Gobble up all the pickles, and do not under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES allow one to pass the
        bottom of your screen. Well, any circumstances, except one... When you gobble a "WWW" logo, you suddenly
        become THE MIGHTY SQUIDWARD. Squidward cannot lose hearts, and will remain himself 10-15 seconds,
        depending on its size. You will obtain points for every pickle you eat (again, depending on its size
        [although this does make getting easier pickles reward you more. But that's game design. The main problem
        is coding.])

Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Pygame 2.1+
    - Python 3.0.0.00+
    - A computer (obviously)
